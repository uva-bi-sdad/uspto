```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.height = 5,
  fig.width = 8.84,
  dev = "CairoSVG",
  fig.ext = "svg"
)
library(uspto)
outDir <- "eda/seed_expand/"
if (!dir.exists(outDir)) outDir <- "../eda/seed_expand/"
```

This example looks at a set of patent applications based on an initial seed set.

## Data Collection

### Setup

Before starting, we'll need to load the package, and point to a directory where we'd like things saved:
```r
# install if needed: remotes::install_guthub("uva-bi-sdad/uspto")
library(uspto)
outDir <- "eda/seed_expand/"
```

### Initial Search

We'll start by identifying a small set of applications with a meteorology Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) class,
and that mention "global warming" or "climate change" in their abstracts:
```{r}
seed_set <- uspto_search(
  'g01w.cpcl. AND ("global warming".ab. "climate change".ab.)',
  "US-PGPUB",
  outFile = paste0(outDir, "seed_set.csv")
)
```

This gives us `r nrow(seed_set)` applications from between `r min(as.Date(seed_set$datePublished))`
and `r max(as.Date(seed_set$datePublished))`.

### Examination Expansions

For some context around the examination of these applications, we'll want to collect all of the other applications
examined by the examiners of the initial set. Examiners are not included in applications,
so we'll need to identify them by the office actions associated with the applications.

#### Seed Office Actions

First, we need to know which examiners examined the seed set of applications:
```{r}
office_actions <- download_office_actions(
  paste0("patentApplicationNumber:(", paste(
    sub("/", "", seed_set$applicationNumber, fixed = TRUE),
    collapse = " "
  ), ")"),
  paste0(outDir, "seed_set_office_actions.json.xz"),
  verbose = FALSE
)
```

From these `r length(office_actions)` office actions, we can get a set of examiners:
```{r}
examiners_ids <- unique(trimws(office_actions$examinerEmployeeNumber))
```

And now we have `r length(examiners_ids)` examiners who examined at least one application
in our seed set.

#### Examiner-Based Expansion

Next, we want to collect all of the other applications our identified examiners examined.
Again, since examiners are not directly associated with applications, we'll have to first collect
all of their office actions:
```{r}
all_office_actions <- download_office_actions(
  paste0("examinerEmployeeNumber:(", paste(examiners_ids, collapse = " "), ")"),
  paste0(outDir, "all_office_actions.json.xz"),
  verbose = FALSE
)
all_applications <- unique(unlist(all_office_actions$patentApplicationNumber))
```

This gives us `r length(all_applications)` total applications. 

### Collect Application Data

There are at least three sources of information that might be of interest when considering the examination
of a patent application: One we have in office actions, another similar to those are the full
prosecution histories, and finally, the text of the applications themselves.

#### Prosecution Histories

Prosecution histories track when happens to an application between the submitter and the patent office.
These are recorded in the Patent Examination Data System (PEDS):

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
examinations_file <- paste0(outDir, "examination_records.json.xz")
if (file.exists(examinations_file)) {
  con <- gzfile(examinations_file)
  examination_records <- fromJSON(readLines(con))
  close(con)
} else {
  # have to break up the calls based on some limit on query length theoretically
  n <- length(all_applications)
  filters <- lapply(
    split(sub("/", "", all_applications, fixed = TRUE), sort(rep_len(seq_len(ceiling(n / 500)), n))),
    function(set) paste0("applId:(", paste(set, collapse = " "), ")")
  )
  examination_records <- unlist(lapply(filters, function(f) {
    unlist(
      download_peds(filters = list(f), verbose = FALSE)$content, FALSE, FALSE
    )
  }), FALSE, FALSE)
  con <- xzfile(examinations_file)
  write_json(examination_records, con, auto_unbox = TRUE)
  close(con)
}
```

### Application Text

Finally, we can collect the actual content of each application, based on the document IDs included in
the examination records:
```{r}
document_ids <- unique(unlist(lapply(examination_records, function(r) {
  if (is.list(r)) r$patentPublicationIdentification$publicationNumber else NULL
})))
document_ids <- document_ids[!is.na(document_ids)]
oriDir <- "eda/original/"
if (!dir.exists(oriDir)) oriDir <- "../eda/original/"
applications <- uspto_download(document_ids, outDir = paste0(oriDir, "applications"))
```

## Analysis

We can start with a simple look at the text to get a feel for what sets our seed set apart:
```{r}
# identify the applications that were part of the initial seed set
applications$seed <- applications$applicationNumber %in% seed_set$applicationNumber

# count up terms used within abstracts
library(lingmatch)
dtm <- lma_dtm(applications$abstractHtml, "function")

# identify the terms that most identify the seed set
term_seed_sim <- lma_simets(t(dtm), !applications$seed, metric = "cosine")
term_seed_sim <- sort(term_seed_sim[term_seed_sim > .25], TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(splot)
splot(
  term_seed_sim ~ names(term_seed_sim),
  type = "bar", sort = FALSE, title = FALSE, labx = FALSE, laby = "Cosine Similarity"
)
```
